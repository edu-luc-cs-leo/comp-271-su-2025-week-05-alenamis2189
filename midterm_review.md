# Midterm reflection Week 05

* **1. Looking at the first five assignments, discuss how you learned from any mistakes you made. Repeating mistakes is a sign that your learning needs to be improved. If you have repeated mistakes, discuss how you learning will be improved in the second half of the course.** .
* **2. Looking at your course engagement over the first six weeks, discuss how you've managed so far. The ideal standard is that you treat the course as a job that you like, that you wish to keep, and in which you aspire to grow and be promoted.**
During the first five assignments, some were more successful than others. My early mistakes included a lack of comments, which I made sure to fix in the later assignments. As the course progressed, the assignments became more challenging and required more time for studying and coding, the coding part I actually enjoyed. However, I started some assignments too late, especially in Week 04, and they ended up taking far more time than I expected. In Week 03, I believe I violated the Programmer’s Pact by including double return statements, something I’ve now corrected and avoided in later work. In the past two assignments, I ran into some issues with compiling. At times, the code didn’t pass all the tests successfully, and once it didn’t compile at all. I plan to revisit those issues to find the root cause and re-run the code until it compiles and behaves correctly. Focusing on course engagement, I’ve consistently attended the lectures and followed expectations, including keeping my camera on. I was never more than five minutes late. I also made sure to participate during class when needed. While I’m not sure exactly how many hours I’ve studied, I know I’ve spent a lot of time coding and fixing mistakes. I realize now that I’ve focused more on problem-solving than reading the textbook, so I plan to shift and include more hours on studying and possibly watching some of the youtube videos on recent topics. Markdown is fairly easy, and it feels better to write these reflections separately from the code, as I did in the first assignment. The one thing I haven’t done yet is reach out to the professor for help. That has always been difficult for me, but I will work to change that. I’ll make it a priority to send an email with questions as soon as they come up so I don’t fall behind.
